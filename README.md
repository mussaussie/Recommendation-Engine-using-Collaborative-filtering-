**Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Engine**

Overview
This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation engine using Python, leveraging the MovieLens dataset (u.data). Collaborative filtering is a technique that predicts user preferences by finding similarities between users based on their item ratings.

Key Features
Data Handling: Utilizes pandas for efficient data manipulation and numpy for numerical computations.
Algorithm: Computes cosine similarity between users to measure their similarity based on ratings they have given to different items.
Prediction: Predicts ratings for items that users haven't rated using a weighted average of ratings from similar users.
Recommendations: Generates personalized recommendations by sorting predicted ratings and recommending top-N items for each user.
Getting Started
Dataset: Use the MovieLens dataset (u.data) or any similar dataset in the format: user_id, item_id, rating, timestamp.
Dependencies: Ensure pandas, numpy, and sklearn are installed (pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn).
Execution:
Load the dataset using pd.read_csv.
Preprocess data, calculate user-item matrix using pivot_table, and fill missing values with 0.
Compute cosine similarity between users using cosine_similarity from sklearn.
Predict ratings for all users and items using the predict_ratings function.
Generate recommendations for a specific user using recommend_items.
Usage

Example usage to get recommendations for user_id 1
user_id = 1
num_recommendations = 5
recommendations = recommend_items(predicted_ratings_df, user_id, num_recommendations)
print(recommendations)
